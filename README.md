# Python Search Engine

## Warning

This is a very rough project and is incomplete in the state I have left it. I just dug it up from an old hard drive and decided to share the code in case anyone is trying to do something similar.

## About

This is a search engine crawler that starts with the wikipedia homepage to crawl and parse webpages and save their body text into raw textfiles.

The anacron file should go in /etc/cron.d and runs via anacron in case you are not running this on a dedicated server. 
Eventually this should be moved to docker to make initialization easier.
